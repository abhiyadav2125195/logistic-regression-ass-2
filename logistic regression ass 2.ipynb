    "Purpose: Grid Search Cross-Validation (Grid Search CV) is used to tune hyperparameters for machine learning models. It systematically searches through a predefined set of hyperparameters to find the combination that yields the best model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: Grid Search CV works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining a grid of hyperparameters to search. For example, you can specify different values for parameters like learning rate, depth of a decision tree, or regularization strength.\n",
    "Evaluating the model's performance using cross-validation for each combination of hyperparameters. Cross-validation splits the training data into multiple subsets, and the model is trained and validated on different subsets to get a robust estimate of performance.\n",
    "Selecting the hyperparameters that result in the best performance, typically based on a specified scoring metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score)."

    "Grid Search CV: Grid search exhaustively explores all possible combinations of hyperparameters specified in a predefined grid. It can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized Search CV: Randomized search randomly samples a specified number of combinations from the hyperparameter space. It is more efficient than grid search when the search space is vast, as it explores a subset of possibilities. It is particularly useful when computational resources are limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing between them: Use grid search when you have a relatively small number of hyperparameters and you want to explore all combinations thoroughly. Use randomized search when you have a large search space, and you want a good chance of finding good hyperparameters without exhaustively trying all possibilities."
